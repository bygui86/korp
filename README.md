# korp

A command line tool for pushing docker images referenced in Kubernetes yaml files into a custom Docker registry. The name `korp` derives from combining the customary shorthand for "corporation" with a k for Kubernetes. The name was chosen because corporate Docker registries are the main use case for the tool.

## Versioning

Current version: `0.5.0`

---

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/swisscom/korp/releases) and unpack it
2. Add the `korp` binary to your PATH

---

## Usage

`korp` has three commands for 1. scanning yaml files, 2. pulling the referenced images and 3. pushing them to the new registry. Patching the yaml files for deployment is delegated to `kustomize` and `kubectl apply -k` since this is a well-established tool set for last-mile customization of Kubernetes yaml files.

### Scan

The `scan` command recursively scans a directory, collects all references to Docker and creates an `images` section in a `kustomization.yml` file.

#### Example

The following command will scan the `templates` directory (and its sub-directories) and create an `images` entry in `kustomization.yml` for each image reference found where the `newName` field is the normalized image name prefixed with `my-registry.example.org`.

```
korp scan -f ./templates -r my-registry.example.org
```

### Pull

The `pull` command will read the `kustomization.yml` file generated by the `scan` command and pull all original images to the local Docker daemon i.e. the Docker daemon which is running on the machine where `korp` is executed.

#### Example

The following command pulls all images referenced by the `name` attribute of the elements of the `images` list in the `kustomization.yml` file in the current directory.

```
korp pull
```

### Push

The `push` command will read the `kustomization.yml` file generated by the `scan` command, tag all referenced images with their new name (including the new registry) and push them. The command assumes that `pull` has already been executed.

#### Example

The following command tags all images according to the `newName` attribute in the corresponding entry of the `images` list and pushes them.

```
korp push
```

### Patching your YAML files

`korp` delegates the actual patching of the image references in the YAML files to `kustomize`. You can use the following steps to apply the `kustomization.yaml` generated by `korp` to your YAML files.

1. Add the required resources to the `kustomization.yaml`. The set of resources depends on your use case. If you want to add all `yaml` files which were scanned by `korp` (excluding the `kustomization.yaml` itself) you can use the following glob pattern.

   ```
   kustomize edit add resource **/!(kustomization).yaml;
   ```

1. Apply your YAML files with `kubectl`.

   ```
   kubectl apply -k .
   ```

### Autocompletion

Source the `autocomplete-scripts/*_autocomplete` file in your `.bashrc | .zshrc` file while setting the `PROG` variable to the name of your program.

#### Method 1

```
go build .
source <(./korp autocompletion zsh)
./korp
# now play with tab
```

#### Method 2

```
go build .
PROG=korp source autocomplete-scripts/zsh_autocomplete
./korp
# now play with tab
```

## Known issues

- CRD image references not recognized (to be fixed in the next release)
