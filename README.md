# korp

A command line tool for pushing docker images into a different Docker registry based on given Kubernetes yaml files.

## Versioning

Current version: `0.5.0`

---

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/swisscom/korp/releases) and unpack it
2. Add the `korp` binary to your PATH

---

## Usage

### Scan

```
korp scan -f <path to yaml files> -r <docker registry name>
```

`example`

```
korp scan -f ./samples/yaml
cat kustomization.yaml
```

### Pull

```
korp pull -k <path to kustomization.yaml>
```

`example`

```
korp scan -f ./samples/yaml
korp pull
docker images
```

### Push

```
korp pull -k <path to kustomization.yaml>
```

`example`

```
docker run -d --name registry --restart always -p 5000:5000 registry
korp scan -f ./samples/yaml -r "localhost:5000"
korp pull
korp push
```

### Patching your YAML files

`korp` delegates the actual patching of the image references in the YAML files to `kustomize`. You can use the following steps to apply the `kustomization.yaml` generated by `korp` to your YAML files.

1. Add the required resources to the `kustomization.yaml`. The set of resources depends on your use case. If you want to add all `yaml` files which were scanned by `korp` (excluding the `kustomization.yaml` itself) you can use the following glob pattern.

   ```
   kustomize edit add resource **/!(kustomization).yaml;
   ```

1. Apply your YAML files with `kubectl`.

   ```
   kubectl apply -k .
   ```

### All

`TODO`

### Debug mode

```
korp -d
```

### Autocompletion

Source the `autocomplete-scripts/*_autocomplete` file in your `.bashrc | .zshrc` file while setting the `PROG` variable to the name of your program.

#### Method 1

```
go build .
source <(./korp autocompletion zsh)
./korp
# now play with tab
```

#### Method 2

```
go build .
PROG=korp source autocomplete-scripts/zsh_autocomplete
./korp
# now play with tab
```
